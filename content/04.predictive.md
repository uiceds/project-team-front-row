## PRJ3.1 Predictive Modeling

#### Predictive Modeling

##### K-means


Based on the analysis conducted on the provided data, a predictive model utilizing k-means clustering can assist in determining ideal locations for the implementation of DUI checkpoints based on crash sites. Adjustment of k in the clustering algorithm can be done using parameters such as resource allocation towards policing in distinct areas. The k-means clustering process will begin by taking crash data with drinking involved within Illinois and the United States. This data will be clustered based on a predefined k value, representative of a decision made based on resource allocation. 

Figure 7 below depicts all of the drunk driving incidents that occurred in Illinois. Using k-means clustering, the instances were grouped into 20 groups based on their location. These groups were then snapped to the nearest major interstate in order to avoid centroid points being placed in unrealistic locations such as over agricultural land.

Additional k-means clustering models were created to provide insights into potential high-risk zones in regards to drunk driving incidents. The seven plots below illustrate the distribution of drunk driving accidents on a daily basis, revealing notable trends throughout the week. Drunk driving incidents show a clear increase during the weekends, likely due to bars, restaurants, and clubs tending to have higher activity on Friday and Saturday nights. On weekdays, drunk driving incidents appear to be more clustered along commuter routes. However, on weekends, these clusters appear to shift to more urbanized areas where more recreational zones and leisure activities may be present. In other words, weekend incidents appear more concentrated on city centers. A k-value of 50 (i.e. 50 centroid points) is used for this analysis; however, this value is arbitrary and can be adjusted to suit the needs of policymakers as to where resources can be allocated to most efficiently drunk driving incidents.

Drunk driving incidents across the entire United States  were further analyzed, as depicted by Figure 8 below. The visualization demonstrates the spatial distribution of all drunk driving accidents and the resulting clusters identified using k-means analysis, offering insight into nationwide trends. As expected, the amount of incidents are most dense in areas with higher populations. However, some major interstates contain higher amounts of centroid points than others, indicating to drivers areas they may want to avoid as well as informing law enforcement areas to increase measures to reduce drunk driving incidents.

Some limitations exist with the k-means modeling process. Running the scripts multiple times often results in different centroid locations with each rerun. In the future, this could be corrected by incorporating a weight system into the clustering. Centroids could be weighted based on factors such as fatality count, whether the incident involved drunk driving, or both. This approach would add consistency to the clustering results and allow the model to better reflect the relative severity and risk associated with each cluster. Additionally, further refinement of the algorithm parameters, such as initializing centroids, could enhance the accuracy and reliability of the model.

Additional consideration was given towards dimensions of time regarding crash likelihood. According to Figure 4, noticeable variation occurs in the amount of accidents occurring at specific times of day, indicating a need to manage resource allocation with time consideration. The implementation of a neural network using the provided data can be applied towards a proposal regarding DUI checkpoint locations or patrol areas in designated areas based on available resources and shift time, therefore optimizing provision of safety from DUI-related incidents.

##### Neural Network

The model below represents a neural network designed to predict high-risk areas for drunk driving accidents in Illinois, potentially useful for the Illinois State Police. It is a multiple dense-layered, supervised, feedforward neural network. Standardization and component engineering were employed to improve model performance. The independent variables used in the model include the day of the week, the hour of the shift, weather conditions, and latitudinal and longitudinal bins corresponding to a twenty-mile radius. The dependent variable is the number of drunk driver crashes. Unlike simply calculating the average number of accidents per area, this model incorporates additional factors such as time and weather conditions, offering a more precise prediction of high-risk areas. By considering these variables, the model allows law enforcement to focus patrol efforts based on the conditions that increase the likelihood of drunk driving accidents, making it a more actionable tool than average-based approaches.

The figures below represent visualizations with varying input data for specific standard police patrol shifts. For instance, a police officer working on a Friday from 12 PM to 12 AM with current rainy weather conditions would input the day, time of shift, and weather into the model. The model would then generate predictions, highlighting the 20-mile radii areas with the highest probabilities of drunk driving accidents, as seen in the upper left of Figure 9. 

The top right of Figure 9 displays the predicted high-risk areas for drunk driving accidents on Saturday from 6 PM to 12 AM under clear weather conditions, while the bottom of Figure 9 illustrates similar predictions for Sunday from 12 AM to 4 AM, but for all weather conditions. Saturday and Sunday have more areas of interests, due that more drunk driving fatalities commonly occur on late Saturday nights, as discussed in the Exploratory Data section. 

After producing the output map, the law enforcement officer could focus patrols on the displayed areas.
