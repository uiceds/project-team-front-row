## PRJ3.1 Predictive Modeling

#### Predictive Modeling


Based on the analysis conducted on the provided data, a predictive model utilizing k-means clustering can assist in determining ideal locations for the implementation of DUI checkpoints based on crash sites. Adjustment of k in the clustering algorithm can be done using parameters such as resource allocation towards policing in distinct areas. The k-means clustering process will begin by taking crash data with drinking involved within Illinois. This data will be clustered based on a predefined k value, representative of a decision made based on resource allocation. 

Additional consideration will be given towards dimensions of time regarding crash likelihood. According to Figure 4, noticeable variation occurs in the amount of accidents occurring at specific times of day, indicating a need to manage resource allocation with time consideration. The implementation of a clustering algorithm using the provided data can be applied towards a proposal regarding DUI checkpoint locations in designated areas based on available resources, therefore optimizing provision of safety from DUI-related incidents.

The model and figures below represent a neural network model that has the potential to be utilized by the Illinois State Police. The inputs to the model consist of day of week, hours of shift, and current weather conditions. The model then predicts which twenty mile radius patrol zones in Illinois will likely yield the highest probability of fatal drunk driving accidents, thus prompting supervisors to direct units to those areas. The model is trained on labeled data, taking into account latitudinal and longitudinal bins of a twenty mile radius in Illinois. The model is a multiple dense-layered, supervised, feedforward neural network.

The figures below represent visualizations with varying input data for specific standard police patrol shifts. 

Possible further development of the nueral network model includes allowing for more input variables (i.e. month, traffic density, etc) and comparing the model to later-year data.
