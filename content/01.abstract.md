## Abstract {.page_break_before}

The dataset that will be used for this project is the Fatality Analysis Reporting System created by the National Highway Safety Administration. The data will be obtained from the NHTSAâ€™s FARS database, which is publicly accessible.The FARS dataset is available in the CSV format and includes 30k+ instances and 70 columns including: location, date, conditions, and nature of the accident. The dataset our team will be analyzing is from 2015-2016.

Using the FARS dataset we aim to understand the trends in traffic fatalities in a given year and what factors are affecting those trends. We will also look at how the different variables play a role in the severity of the accident and identify geographic regions that are more prone to accidents. The trends in traffic fatalities found through this project can be used to inform policy makers and ultimately decrease the number of traffic fatalities.
