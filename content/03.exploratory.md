## PRJ2.1 Exploratory Data Analysis  

#### Exploratory Data Analysis

The dataset that we have chosen describes the details surrounding motor vehicle crashes in the United States during the year 2015. 

From the data, we have interpreted that 32,166 fatal crashes occured in 2015. Out of the total number of crashes, 26.78% of accidents involved an intoxicated driver. In the state of Illinois, 264 of 914 crashes involved a drunk driver (28.9%). More statistics are found in the table below. 


  | Data Summary        | Statistic        |

To understand the trends in the data, we first analyzed the location of accidents and how the location relates to other variables. We looked at a map of the United states to plot the fatal accidents vs the drunk driving fatal accidents, as seen in Figure 1. This visualtion shows hotspots for both categories which are generally in more populous areas and in coastal regions.

We then created a scatter plot to visualize the number of accidents and fatalities per accident for the United States. As seen in the figure, most of the crashes result in only one fatality, however, there are a handful of multiple fatality crashes. The scatter plot annotates the amount of crashes for drunk drivers and sober drivers next to the datapoint.

The next factor that we analyzed to understand the data was the specific day of accidents. As seen in the figure below, the highest number of accidents occurred on the weekends. On average, 104 accidents occurred on a given day of a weekend whereas 82 accidents occurred per weekday. Monday and Tuesday have the lowest number of accidents and as the week progresses, the number of accidents increases. 

The portion of accidents due to drunk driving by the day of the week follows similar trends. The average ratio of  drunk driving accidents to total number of accidents was 37.47% for the weekend and 21.19% for weekdays. This is most likely due to the fact that drinking is more popular on the weekends. Similarly, there is a figure for crashes vs time of day.

Our team also looked at the number of drunk driver accidents per day of the year. See Table 1 for the most popular days for drunk driver accidents. The total number of accidents by hour of the day is the highest at 3 AM and decreases until 8 AM. The number of accidents then gradually increases by the hour.

Looking at the total number of DUI related accidents throughout the year, the summer months see higher numbers of accidents.

As we conducted our Exploratory Data Analysis, we aimed to focus in on the state of Illinois. Below is the same information as Figure 1, but specific to Illinois for 2015. From this visual, we can see that most crashes are in the areas with larger cities (i.e. Chicago).

#### Predictive Modeling


Based on the analysis conducted on the provided data, a predictive model utilizing k-means clustering can assist in determining ideal locations for the implementation of DUI checkpoints based on crash sites. Adjustment of k in the clustering algorithm can be done using parameters such as resource allocation towards policing in distinct areas. The k-means clustering process will begin by taking crash data with drinking involved within Illinois. This data will be clustered based on a predefined k value, representative of a decision made based on resource allocation. 

Additional consideration will be given towards dimensions of time regarding crash likelihood. According to Figure 4, noticeable variation occurs in the amount of accidents occurring at specific times of day, indicating a need to manage resource allocation with time consideration. The implementation of a clustering algorithm using the provided data can be applied towards a proposal regarding DUI checkpoint locations in designated areas based on available resources, therefore optimizing provision of safety from DUI-related incidents.
